TODO:
- Implement asm! macro fully
- Get all run-pass and run-fail tests passing resolve
 - Lots of fixes to do here
 - Including a quirk in lookup for `<Foo>::Bar` searching traits
- "Compile" rustc
- Audit TODOs in codebase
- MIR Optimisations
 - Assignment elision (e.g. remove intermediate temporaries assigned to RETURN)
 - Dead code eliminiation
 - BB Unificiation
- HIR Optimisation (remove dead code in `if true/if false` branches)
- Basic codegen such that `hello.rs` runs
- Convert enum variants to point to structs for the data type
 - This may have to wait for a rustc RFC? (or can hide the structs for now)
- Clean up Span code to correctly handle nested spans
- Clean up AST
 - Almost done, just a few little niggles left
- Split arg patterns and arg types up for cleaner serialisation
 - Could be a good idea to do as part of changing HIR::TraitImpl to only contain the impl data
 - May not be too useful due to argument monomorphisation.
