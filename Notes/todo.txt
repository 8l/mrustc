TODO:
- Replace `box` desugaring with passthrough to HIR which will replace with operator call after typeck
 - See https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1426#r48383364
 - May require a design/notes doc covering the inferrence behavior.
- Audit TODOs in codebase
- Method and type monomorphisation
- Test compile against a no_std program
- MIR Optimisations
- HIR Optimisation (remove dead code in `if true/if false` branches)
- Convert enum variants to point to structs for the data type
- Clean up Span code to correctly handle nested spans
- Clean up AST
- Explit arg patterns and arg types up for cleaner serialisation
