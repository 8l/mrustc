Type inferrence


# Type equality procedure

## Requirements
- Called to indicate that two types (passed as `const ::HIR::TypeRef&` from the HIR) must be the same
- Must handle cases where either of the passed typerefs point to aliased inferrence vars

## Rough procedure
- Locate real type pointed to by both arguments
- If neither have concrete information, alias the right to the left
- If both are concrete, ensure that both are equal (recursing for infer)
- If only one is concrete, alias the infer to it
